At present farmers and retailers do not get the right price for their produce. With this
problem in mind, we want to create a social media medium where buyers and sellers can
buy and sell independently. Farmers will have their own profiles. Each seller will show
how many ratings there are with the profile. If the farmers post a sale of their products,
the buyer or retailer will be able to purchase the product in two persons. After buying and
selling, they will be able to express their opinions through each other's ratings.
